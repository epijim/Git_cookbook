![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epijim/RecipeBook/master/TufteStyle/graphics/beetroothummus.png "Logo Title Text 1")

* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tin chick peas
* 2 tablespoons tahini
* 2 cloves garlic
* Large sprinkle toasted cumin seeds
* 4 small cooked beetroot
* Salt and pepper to taste

*You can replace with almost anything! My favourite is half a block feta and 4 dates, roughly chopped.*

Put everything in a food processor.

Blitz it, adding water to get the looseness you want.

Serve with sumac and cumin sprinkled on top.
