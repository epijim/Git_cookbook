# The blackbook cookbook

The majority of these recipes are from Bill’s recipe notebook, which is a continuos document that he has curated over many years.

He makes no claim to inventing the recipe, but every recipe has been meticulously tested. This book is designed to be written, and updated. Much like the original notebook this recipe book is based off.

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, recipes distributed here are on a “as is” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. We take responsibility for any kitchen disasters that you may experience.
