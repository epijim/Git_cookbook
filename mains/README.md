![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epijim/RecipeBook/master/TufteStyle/graphics/breadcrumbpasta.png "Logo Title Text 1")

* Spaghetti or linguine for three
* 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, more as needed
* 12 anchovies, chopped
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 cup good dried bread crumbs
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce (optional)
* 1 teaspoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco, or to taste
* 1/2 cup roughly chopped parsley
* Peas, asparagus, or any quick cooking vegetable (optional)
* Lemon wedges, for serving}

In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, warm oil. Add anchovies, garlic and red pepper flakes; cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Stir in bread crumbs and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Season liberally with black pepper, and a little salt if needed.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook according to package instructions; drain well, reserving some of the pasta water (about 1/2 cup is plenty). If vegetables are being added, chuck them into the pasta a few minutes before the end.

In a large, preferably warmed bowl, stir together egg yolks, fish sauce, hot sauce and 2 tablespoons pasta water. Add hot pasta and toss well, adding more pasta water if the mixture looks dry or unevenly yellow. You want the yolk to evenly coat the pasta but you donâ€™t want it to be soupy. Add bread crumb mixture and parsley and toss well.

Season with plenty of black pepper, and salt to taste. Drizzle pasta with more oil just before serving and serve with lemon wedges.

## Phat thai

* 120g 2-3mm wide flat rice sticks
* 60ml fish sauce
* 60ml tamarind water
* 60g palm sugar
* Pinch of chilli powder, to taste
* 80ml groundnut or vegetable oil
* 2 cloves of garlic, finely chopped
* 100g extra-firm tofu, chopped into small cubes
* 8 large prawns
* 2 large eggs, ready cracked
* 1 tbsp small dried shrimp
* 100g beansprouts
* 4 stalks Chinese chives, chopped
* 50g roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
* Lime wedges, chilli flakes, fish sauce and sugar, to garnish}

Soak the rice sticks in cold water for about half an hour until pliable but al dente. Drain.

Meanwhile, make the sauce by combining the fish sauce, tamarind and palm sugar in a small pan. Heat gently to dissolve the sugar and taste. Add more of any of the ingredients as you wish. Season with chilli to taste. Set aside.

Lay out all the ingredients within easy reach of the hob in the order they'll be used. Put a wok on a high heat and add half the oil. Add the garlic, stir fry for a few seconds, then add the noodles and a splash of water. Stir fry until they're drying out, then add the sauce. Fry until they are almost soft enough to eat (they should be slightly chewy).

Push the noodles to the side of the wok and add the rest of the oil. Fry the tofu and prawns until the tofu is beginning to colour, then push to the side and add the eggs. Pierce the yolks and, when starting to set on the bottom, scramble.

Stir through the noodles, and add the radish, dried shrimp, beansprouts, chives and peanuts. Stir fry until well combined, then serve with the garnishes for people to add as they wish.

## Paella

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epijim/RecipeBook/master/TufteStyle/graphics/paella.png "Logo Title Text 1")

* 250g tomatoes, with x in top\sidenote{}
* 100ml olive oil
* 6 chicken thighs\sidenote{You can easily omit either the chicken or prawns}
* 220g chorizo, sliced
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 green pepper, finely chopped
* 1 red pepper, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 1/2 tsp sweet paprika
* 1/2 tsp cayanne pepper
* Large pinch of saffron
* 350g paella rice
* 1.2L stock
* 75g fresh peas
* 12 tiger prawns
* 3 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsely leaves
* Finely chopped zest and juice of one lemon

*We usually omit the chicken, and substitute the fresh for tinned tomatoes.*

Boil the tomatoes for 10 seconds then skin and deseed.

Heat the oil in a large frying pan to medium and fry the chicken skin side down till dark brown.

Remove the chicken and add chorizo.

*I like to blend 1/3 of the chorizo so it melts into the paella, but that's completely optional.*

Soon after, add the peppers and garlic and fry for 3 minutes.

Add the spices and rice. After a few minutes, once the rice starts to go clear, add the stock and tomatoes and bring to the boil.

*If you deheaded the shrimp, I like to add it to the stock while it's heating (discard before adding to the paella).*

Turn the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes with the lid off.

Then add back the chicken, with the prawns and peas, and cook for 15 more minutes. If the prawns are really large, turn them once by hand to make sure they cook through.

Squeeze over a lemon and sprinkle with zest and juice.

## Pork and Prune Pie

* 400g diced pork
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 tbsp oil
* 1 onion, diced finely
* 4 apples, peeled and chopped
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 cups apple juice or cider
* 150g pitted prunes
* Shortcrust pastry packet
* 4 tbsp milk

Toss pork in flour and fry until lightly brown, then put aside.

Fry onion, garlic and apple for 3 minutes.

Add apple juice or cider and and prunes and deglaze.

Add everything except pastry and milk,  and cook for an hour or till meat tender.

Let it cool, then make pie and glaze pastry with milk.

## Moroccan lamb
