**For curry:**
* 4 skinless chicken thighs or breasts
* 2 onions
* Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
* 1/2 bunch fresh coriander
* 1 fresh red chilli
* 400g tin of chopped tomatoes
* 1/2 400g tin coconut cream
* Handful of flaked almonds, to serve
* 1 lemon, to serve}

**For spice paste:**
* 2 cloves of garlic
* Thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger
* 1 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1 teaspoon coriander seeds
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 2 teaspoons garam masala
* 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
* 2 tablespoons groundnut oil
* 2 tablespoons tomato puree
* Small bunch of fresh coriander
* 1/2 tablespoon desiccated coconut
* 2 tablespoons ground almonds}

To make the curry paste, halve, deseed and roughly chop the chillies, then peel the garlic and ginger.

Put a frying pan over a medium-high heat and add the cumin and coriander seeds. Lightly toast for a few minutes, or until golden brown and smelling delicious, then remove from the heat.

Add the toasted spices to a pestle and mortar and grind until fine, or put them in a food processor and whiz to a powder.

Once you've ground them, add the toasted spices to a food processor along with the remaining paste ingredients and whiz to a smooth paste, then put to one side.

Slice the chicken lengthways into 2cm strips.

On a clean chopping board, peel, halve and finely slice the onions. Peel and finely slice the ginger, then pick the coriander leaves and put to one side, finely chopping the stalks along with the chilli.

Place a large casserole pan over a medium-high heat and add a couple of lugs of oil. Once hot, add the onions, chilli, ginger and coriander stalks, then cook for around 10 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden.

Add the chicken and roughly 140g of the tikka masala paste, stirring well so everything is nicely coated. Season with salt and pepper, add the tomatoes and coconut milk (save the rest for another day), then bring everything to the boil.

Turn the heat down to medium-low, cover and simmer for 20 minutes, then take the lid off and cook for further 5 minutes, or until the meat is tender and the sauce has reduced, stirring occasionally.

Divide the curry between bowls, sprinkle over the almonds and coriander leaves. Serve with fluffy rice, a dollop of yoghurt and lemon wedges for squeezing over.

## Kedgeree

* 250 g basmati rice
* 4 large free-range eggs
* 2 lemons
* 2 fresh bay leaves
* 500 g undyed smoked haddock fillets, skin off, bones removed
* olive oil
* 1 knob of butter
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 1 small bunch of fresh coriander, leaves picked, stalks finely chopped
* 1 red chilli, deseeded and finely sliced
* 1 heaped tablespoon Madras curry paste
* lemon wedges
* Natural yoghurt
* Chilli, sliced

*The curry paste can also be swapped out for English style curry powder if you want to keep the recipe closer to it's 70's popularity, rather than it's Indo-british roots.*

Bring 2 large pans of salted water to the boil. Wash the rice till the water runs clear and all the starch has been washed away. Add the rice to one pan and cook for 2 minutes less than the cooking instructions.

Add the eggs and bay leaves to the other pan and squeeze in the juice of half a lemon. Add the squeezed lemon half to the pan and leave to simmer for 7–8 minutes, adding the haddock halfway through.

Meanwhile, get a large pan on a medium heat and add a drizzle of oil and the butter. Add the onion and fry for a few minutes, then add the coriander stalks and chilli and leave them to sweat. The slower you cook them, the sweeter they'll be.

When the rice is cooked, drain it, and put aside. After 3–4 minutes your haddock should be flaking apart; carefully pour most of the water away.

Transfer the eggs to a colander and rinse them under the cold tap until they're cool enough to peel. Discard the bay leaves and lemon half.

Add the curry paste to the pan of onions and stir it through, fry for 5 more minutes then take the pan off the heat. Tip in your rice and stir it through – don't totally mix, it's nice to have a bit of a marbled effect.

Roughly chop your peeled eggs into the pan, then flake over the haddock. Roughly chop most of the coriander leaves and add most of them to the pan with the juice from the remaining lemon. Gently fold it all together.

Pop the pan on a low heat for 5 minutes to get nice and hot, then have a taste and adjust the seasoning. You shouldn't need too much as the smoked fish gives it lots of flavour.

Get a fork and fold it over a few times to keep it nice and light. When you hear a great sizzling, take it off the heat, scatter over the reserved coriander, pop in some lemon wedges and serve with yoghurt and sliced chilli, if desired.
