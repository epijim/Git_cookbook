* 14 ounces chocolate wafers, finely ground
* 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 pumpkin, roasted and blended.*
You can also use 3 sweet potatoes, or 2 squashes. Just make sure to roast, not boil, and add a little water when you puree.*
* 1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
* 1/2 lemon, juiced
* 5 tablespoons salted butter, melted
* 3 1/2 tablespoons light brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
* 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
* Sweetened whipped cream:
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 cup superfine sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Cadbury flake

Preheat oven to 170&#8451;.

**For crust:**

In a large bowl mix together the chocolate wafer crumbs and melted butter until fully incorporated. Press the mixture into a pie dish or tart shell, pressing both evenly on the bottom and up the sides. Place onto a baking sheet and then into the refrigerator until ready to use.

**For filling:** Place pumpkin puree in a bowl and add the remaining filling ingredients. Stir together until fully incorporated and no lumps remain. Pour the filling into the prepared crust and carefully set into the lowest rack of the oven. Bake for 55 to 70 minutes or until the filling has set, but is slightly loose in the middle.

Allow pie to cool completely, about 2 hours.

**For sweetened cream:** Pour cream, sugar and vanilla extract into a mixing bowl and beat together using an electric hand mixer until stiff peaks form.

Generously top pie with whipped cream and finish with the crumbled flake to serve.

## German mess

Apparently it's called "Raspberry Dream" in Germany. Really, it's an Eton Mess. The substitution of cream for the cheeses makes it taste a lot less creamy.

* 200g meringue
* 500g frozen raspberries
* 500g mascarpone (*or instead: 250g sour cream and 250g soft cheese*)
* 250g quark
* vanilla essence

Mix mascarpone, quark, and vanilla.

Break meringue in pieces (*not too small*).

Fill mascarpone mix, raspberries and meringue in a bowl in layers.

Leave for 3-4 hours in the fridge.
