## Couscous with spinach, almonds and feta

* 1 cup couscous
* 1 cup vege stock
* olive oil
* Large handful spinach
* 100g feta chopped
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 3 tbsp slivered almonds
* zest of one lemon
* 1/2 cup sultanas
* Greek yoghurt to serve

Prepare the couscous with the stock.

Saute onions with oil for 4 minutes.

Add almonds and zest till nuts start to brown.

*At the last minute add spinach.
This is super flexible. In the picture, we replaced spinach with beetroot and mushrooms*

Fluff up couscous, add onion, cheese and sultanas.

Serve with yoghurt.

## Spinach, blue cheese and pear salad

* 3 rinsed pears, cut into chunks
* 200g baby spinach
* 1/2 cup blue cheese
* 1/2 cup toasted walnuts
* Lemon juice
* 4 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp honey
* 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
* Parmesan shavings

*I also really like this salad with a strong goats cheese.*


Splash the cut pears with lemon juice to prevent them browning.

Whisk together the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and honey to make a vinaigrette.

Season the vinaigrette, remembering to underseason if the cheese is salty.

Fold together all the ingredients except the parmesan and walnuts, which get scattered on when serving.
